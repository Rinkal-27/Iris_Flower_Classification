# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview

This project implements the classification of the Iris dataset using two machine learning models:

**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

**Random Forest Classifier**

The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and split into training and testing sets before model training and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with the following features:

**Sepal length (cm)**

**Sepal width (cm)**

**Petal length (cm)**

**Petal width (cm)**

**Class (Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)**

## Requirements

To run this project, install the following dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Steps Involved

**Load the Dataset:** Fetches the Iris dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Displays dataset summary and generates pair plots for visualization.

**Data Preprocessing:** Splits the dataset into training and testing sets and applies feature scaling.

**Model Training & Testing:**

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

**Evaluation:** Calculates accuracy of both models.

## Results

The KNN and Random Forest classifiers achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test dataset.
